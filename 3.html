    <p>In capoeira, music sets the rhythm, the style of play, and the energy of a game. In its most traditional setting, there are three main styles of song that weave together the structure of the capoeira roda.</p> 
    <p>The roda represents the most strict and traditional format for capoeira and is ideally suited for an introduction and discussion of the music.</p> 
    <p>Though we may consider the music traditional, because it has been passed orally from one to the next until the early - mid 20th century when songs and rhythms began to be notated and recorded, there is no record of to what extent and exactly how the music has evolved over time.</p>
